  batch-folder: "batches"
  # The file extension for batch files.
  file-extension: ".batch"
  # Timer mode for !sleep commands.
  # 'ticks': Uses the server tick loop (1 second = 20 ticks). Tied to server performance (lag affects time).
  # 'realtime': Uses the system clock (Thread.sleep). More accurate to real time, runs asynchronously.
  timer-mode: "ticks"

security:
  # If true, commands matching the blacklist will be removed from the batch before execution.
  remove-dangerous-commands: true
