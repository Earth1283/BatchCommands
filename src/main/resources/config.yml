# ==============================================================================
# BatchCommands Main Configuration
# ==============================================================================

settings:
  # The subdirectory in the plugin folder where batch files are stored.
  # Default: "batches"
  # Example: "scripts" would look in "plugins/BatchCommands/scripts/"
  batch-folder: "batches"

  # The file extension for batch files.
  # Default: ".batch"
  # Note: The plugin will automatically append this if the user doesn't type it.
  file-extension: ".batch"

  # Timer mode for !sleep commands (e.g., !sleep 5).
  # Options:
  #   - 'ticks': Uses the server tick loop (1 second = 20 ticks).
  #     Pros: Synchronized with game logic. Cons: Slows down if the server lags (low TPS).
  #   - 'realtime': Uses the system clock (Thread.sleep).
  #     Pros: Accurate to real-world time. Cons: Runs independently of server ticks.
  timer-mode: "ticks"

security:
  # If true, commands matching the blacklist will be removed from the batch before execution.
  # If false, dangerous commands will be executed (NOT RECOMMENDED).
  remove-dangerous-commands: true

  # List of commands that are not allowed to be executed via batch files.
  # These checks are performed case-insensitively.
  # The check compares the first word of the command (e.g., "stop" matches "/stop now").
  command-blacklist:
    - "stop"
    - "restart"
    - "op"
    - "deop"
    - "reload"
    - "rl"
