# ==============================================================================
# BatchCommands Linter Configuration
# ==============================================================================
# This file controls the "Linter" feature, which checks batch files for common
# mistakes (like typos) before executing them.

# Master switch to enable or disable the entire linter.
# Default: true
enabled: true

rules:
  # Checks if the command exists on the server.
  # It compares the command against the server's HelpMap (list of all commands).
  # Default: true
  check-command-existence: true

  # If an unknown command is found, try to find a similar valid command
  # and suggest it (e.g., "Unknown command 'gm'. Did you mean 'gamemode'?").
  # Uses Levenshtein distance algorithm.
  # Default: true
  suggest-alternatives: true

  # [Future Feature] Warn if a command in the file is missing a leading slash?
  # Currently, the plugin handles commands with or without slashes, but you might
  # want to enforce a style.
  # Default: false
  warn-on-missing-slash: false

  # Warn if a command is blacklisted (e.g., "stop", "op").
  # This duplicates the security check but provides a warning report before execution.
  # Default: true
  warn-on-blacklisted: true

  # Warn if an unknown meta-command (starting with !) is used.
  # Currently only !sleep is supported.
  # Default: true
  warn-unknown-meta: true

  # Warn if a meta-command has invalid syntax (e.g., "!sleep" without a number).
  # Default: true
  warn-invalid-syntax: true

  # Warn if the batch file contains no valid commands.
  # Default: true
  warn-empty-file: true

# Execution Settings
execution:
  # The maximum time (in milliseconds) the linter is allowed to run before timing out.
  # This prevents large files or complex checks (like Levenshtein) from causing lag or delays.
  # Default: 100
  max-lint-time-ms: 100

  # What to do if the linter exceeds the max time?
  # Options:
  #   - SKIP_LINTER: Stop linting and proceed with execution immediately. (Default)
  #   - CANCEL_EXECUTION: Stop everything and do not run the batch file.
  on-timeout: SKIP_LINTER

  # If true, prints a performance report showing how long each lint step took.
  # Useful for optimizing your lint-order or max-lint-time-ms.
  # Default: false
  debug-mode: false

  # The order in which checks are performed.
  # You can reorder these to prioritize faster checks (like syntax) before slower ones (like command existence).
  # Available checks:
  #   - META_SYNTAX (Checks !sleep arguments, etc.) - fast
  #   - UNKNOWN_META (Checks for unknown ! commands) - fast
  #   - BLACKLIST (Checks against security blacklist) - fast
  #   - EXISTENCE (Checks if command exists on server) - slow (requires looking up command map)
  lint-order:
    - META_SYNTAX
    - UNKNOWN_META
    - BLACKLIST
    - EXISTENCE

# Custom validation patterns (Regex).
# You can add custom rules to warn about specific command patterns.
custom-patterns:
  # Example: Warn if someone tries to use a selector without arguments
  # - "^/kill @e$"
